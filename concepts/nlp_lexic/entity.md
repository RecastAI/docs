## Definition
An entity is a **keyword** that is extracted from an expression.
We automatically detect <a href="https://cai.tools.sap/docs/concepts/gold-entities" target="_blank" >28 different entities</a> such as Datetime, Location, Person, and so on.
We call them **gold entities**.
However, you're not limited to these gold entities. You can also tag your own **custom entities** to detect keywords depending on your bot's context, such as subway stations if you're building a transport assistant.

## Gold entities

All gold entities are detected automatically. This means that you cannot deactivate them and train them. To provide a precise service with true added value, we enrich each gold entity with essential core information.
For example, when the gold entity \`tomorrow\` is detected in a sentence, a formatted version of the datetime that you can use as a reply is returned.

~~~ json
{
  "formatted": "Thursday, 06 October 2018 at 09:00:00 AM",
  "iso": "2018-10-06T09:00:00Z",
  "accuracy": "day",
  "chronology": "future",
  "raw": "tomorrow",
  "confidence": 0.92
}
~~~

## Custom entities

You don’t have to tag everything in your expressions. Just annotate what really **needs** to be extracted.
You can use custom entities for three different reasons:

1) You want to detect all possible occurrences of something in a sentence. For example, you're building a transport bot and you want to detect all subway stations.

2) You want to understand if something is present or not in a sentence.

3) Entities have an influence on intent detection. You can create a custom entity unique to an intent to facilitate this intent’s detection.

Custom entities can be either **free** or **restricted**.

### How free custom entities work

A **free** custom entity is used when you don't have a strict list of values and want machine learning to detect all possible values. For example, you want to detect book titles.

These entities are detected through machine learning. This means that you need to provide examples of the characteristics to train the detection, that is, provide possible values and the way the entity is used in a sentence.

To train a **free** custom entity:

1) In your intent, tag the appropriate words (by highlighting a word or group of words, and adding the entity label). Annotate it in each expression and continue to add expressions until your entity is detected automatically.

![tag entity](https://cdn.cai.tools.sap/man/nlp-lexic/tag-entity.png)

2) You can also provide a list of values for this entity without tagging it in sentences. In SAP Conversational AI, go to *Entities* and just add synonyms. These values are combined with the expressions you annotated to improve the training of our entity detection system. **Caution:** If you provide too many examples of values in this list of synonyms, the algorithm will give more weight to the list of synonyms and less to the contextual information of the tagged expressions.

### How restricted custom entities work

A **restricted** custom entity is used if you have a strict list of words to detect and don't need automatic detection of the entity. No word can be recognized as an entity if it doesn’t appear in a closed list of synonyms. For example, you build a bot to help your customers order pizza. You want to detect all pizza names that your restaurant offers.

To create a **restricted** custom entity:

In SAP Conversational AI, go to *Entities*, click **CREATE**, and select **Restricted entity**. Then add values (synonyms) for this entity. You can also upload a CSV file or use the [gazette endpoint of the API](https://cai.tools.sap/docs/api-reference/#gazettes) to quickly create a large list of synonyms.

![synonyms](https://cdn.cai.tools.sap/man/nlp-lexic/synonym-list.png)

You can define a strictness parameter that is used to determine if a word matches a given value in your list. With a strictness of 100, a word must exactly match an entry of the list to be detected as such.

You can still tag a **restricted** custom entity in your sentences, but it will not help entity detection. It will just provide additional information for intent classification.

### Importing synonyms with a CSV file

To import synonyms, you need to specify the actual value of the synonym as well as the ISO code for the language of the value.


| Key         | Required | Value  | Description                   |
| ----------- | -------- | -------| ----------------------------- |
| value       | Yes      | String | The synonym                   |
| language    | Yes      | String | The ISO code for the language |

<br>
Please format the CSV file as follows:
~~~
"value","language"
"The Big Apple","en"
"NYC","en"
"New York","en"
"New York City","en"
"la grande pomme","fr"
"nou yorke","fr"
~~~

<br>

| value           | language |
| --------------- | -------- |
| NYC             | en       |
| The Big Apple   | en       |
| la grande pomme | fr       |

<br>

When importing synonyms, please note the following:

* You can import up to 10,000 synonyms at the same time.
* Be sure not to exceed the file size limit of 1 MB.
* The import process using the merge option is not executed if the value of the synonym already exists.


## Custom entity enrichments

Whenever an entity is detected, the JSON returned by the NLP API is enriched with additional information about the entity. For example, the following JSON is for a datetime, which is a gold entity.

~~~ json
{
  "formatted": "Thursday, 06 October 2018 at 09:00:00 AM",
  "iso": "2018-10-06T09:00:00Z",
  "accuracy": "day",
  "chronology": "future",
  "raw": "tomorrow",
  "confidence": 0.92
}
~~~

Enrichments for gold entities are fixed by the SAP Conversational AI team and cannot be configured. However, you can configure additional enrichments for custom entities. For example, you create the custom entity `#CHEESE` for your shopping assistant. When "Cheddar" is detected in a sentence, you could have this JSON:

~~~ json
{
  "value": "cheddar",
  "raw": "cheddar",
  "origin": "USA, Wisconsin",
  "price": "$1.30",
  "confidence": 0.92
}
~~~

You do this configuration in two steps:

1) Define new JSON keys (like "origin" and "price" in this example).

2) Define specific enrichments for these keys (for example, the desired price).

### Key

You can create new JSON keys by providing a name and a default enrichment.

![new key](https://cdn.cai.tools.sap/man/nlp-lexic/new_custom_key.png)

![keys](https://cdn.cai.tools.sap/man/nlp-lexic/new_custom_key_2.png)

An enrichment value must be a [valid JSON value](https://www.json.org/).

Keys are language-independent, while enrichments are language-dependent. For example, if you create the key "price", it will always be present in your JSON in all languages. If you don't define an enrichment for this key, null will be sent, for example, `{ "price": null }`.

### Specific enrichment

The default enrichment for a key can be overridden with specific enrichments.
A single key can have several specific enrichments.

A specific enrichment is configured with:
- A valid JSON value
- A list of entity values

![enrichments](https://cdn.cai.tools.sap/man/nlp-lexic/specific_enrichments.png)

The list of entity values is used at runtime. When a custom entity is detected, the corresponding value
is compared to this list of entity values to decide which specific enrichment should be applied. For example, in the case of our entity `#CHEESE` and its enrichments, if the value `mozzarella` is detected in a sentence, the enriched JSON is as follows:

~~~ json
{
  "raw": "mozzarella",
  "value": "mozzarella",
  "deliciousness": -10,
  "confidence": 0.92
}
~~~

For a restricted entity, the list of entity values is a subset of the entity synonyms.

For a free entity, the list of entity values is free and created manually. Additionally, you can configure a matching strictness for a free entity.


## References between entities

### Resolve pronouns

For users to meaningfully converse with your chatbot using natural language, your bot needs to be able to recognize pronouns (like *it* or *that*) and map them to entities previously mentioned in the conversation. In the following example, the pronoun *it* refers to the entity *Apple USB-C to HDMI dongle*.

<img src='https://cdn.cai.tools.sap/man/nlp-lexic/entity-and-pronoun-example.png' width='380px' />

For your bot to resolve pronouns, you must first go to the **Settings** page for your bot, choose **Options**, and select the **Resolve pronouns** checkbox. (The default setting is not selected.) Selecting this checkbox enables your bot to resolve the following pronouns: she, he, it, we, they, her, him, it, us, them, his, this, that.

<img src='https://cdn.cai.tools.sap/man/nlp-lexic/resolve-pronouns-checkbox.png' width='300px' />

With this checkbox selected, the bot now successfully maps the pronoun *it* to the entity *Apple USB-C to HDMI dongle*.

<img src='https://cdn.cai.tools.sap/man/nlp-lexic/entity-and-pronoun-resolved.png' width='380px' />

The following are not supported:

* Split antecedents

  This is where you have more than one entity (for example, *Check whether Harry and Sally are available*) before a pronoun is used that encompasses these multiple entities (for example, *Set up a meeting with them*).

* Cataphora

  This is the use of a pronoun that refers to or stands for a subsequent entity (for example, *When she arrives, let Sally know I’ll be waiting in the conference room*).

Remember to set a message that your bot can use if it is unable to map the pronoun to an entity. For example, if your bot is unable to map the pronoun *her* to a person, you might want to set the message *Sorry, can you please name the person?* To do this, first open the skill. Under **Requirements**, click **EDIT REPLIES** next to **If #person is missing** and enter the message.

### Resolve descriptions

When a user is conversing with your bot in English, French, or Spanish, and your bot replies with a list, carousel, quick replies, or buttons, the user can refer to an item in the message using a superlative like *cheapest* or *most expensive*. For example, if the bot displays a list of flights, the user can tell the bot to book the cheapest or shortest flight, or to book the first or last flight.

For your bot to map superlatives to items in the message, you must select the **Resolve descriptions** checkbox on the **Settings** page for your bot under **Options**. Remember that only English, French, and Spanish are presently supported.

When mapping superlatives to items in a message, the bot will always use the most recent list, carousel, quick replies, or buttons in the conversation history (if the conversation history contains more than one of these).

Certain superlatives can describe different types of entities. For example, _longest_ can refer to duration and distance. If the message contains more than one of these entity types, the bot will always choose the first entity type that the superlative can refer to. For example, if flight CAI 001 is listed as 3 hours and 1,000 miles, the bot will interpret *longest* as referring to the duration of 3 hours.

Remember to set a message that your bot can use if it is unable to map the description to an entity. You can also use the information provided by superlatives in a webhook. The detected superlatives can be enriched with this information in the NLP JSON.

## Retrieving your bot's entities with an API call

You can fetch the entities for a specific bot with an API call. For more information, please see [Indexing A Dataset’s Entities](https://cai.tools.sap/docs/api-reference/#indexing-a-dataset-39-s-entities) in the API Reference.
