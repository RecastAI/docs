# Organization

Organizations are shared accounts where groups of people can collaborate across many bots at once. Administrators can manage member access to the organization's bots.

## Create and manage an organization

From your profile, you can create **private** and **public** organizations. Everyone can view public organizations : the bots inside as well as the members. Private organizations are only visible by its members.

Inside an organization, all members have the same permissions on bots. Only admins can update the members list and change the settings of the organization.

## Transfer your bots

To transfer an existing bot, go to the settings page of this bot, and under the **danger** zone you can transfer the bot to one of your organization.

## What's the difference between user and organization account?

Your user account is your identity on Recast.AI. Your user account can be a member of any number of organizations.
