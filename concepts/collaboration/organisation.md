# Organizations

Organizations are shared accounts, allowing groups of people to collaborate on many bots at the same time. Administrators manage member access to an organization's bots.

## Create and manage an organization

From your profile, you can create **private** and **public** organizations. Everyone can view public organizations, their bots, as well as their members. Private organizations can only be viewed by their members.

Within an organization, all members have the same bot permissions. However, only administrators can update the members list and change the organization settings.

## Transfer your bots

To transfer an existing bot, go to the **Settings** page for the bot. Under **Danger Zone**, you can can then transfer the bot to one of your organizations.

## What's the difference between my user account and an organization account?

Your user account is your identity on Recast.AI. Your user account can be a member of any number of organizations.
