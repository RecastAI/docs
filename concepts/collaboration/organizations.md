Organizations are shared accounts, allowing groups of people to collaborate on several bots at the same time. Your user account (which is your identity on SAP Conversational AI) can be a member of any number of organizations.

## Create an organization

From your profile, you can create **private** and **public** organizations.

Public organizations, their public bots, and members are visible to all. Private organizations, their bots, and members are visible only to the members of the organization.

## Manage an organization

An organization must always have at least one administrator. If an organization has only one administrator, the administrator will be unable to update their own role, remove themselves from the organization, or delete their account until they make another member an administrator.

### Add or remove members

If you are the administrator of an organization, you can add and remove members from the organization. To add members, go to the **Members** tab and click **+ NEW MEMBER**. To remove a member, go to the **Members** tab, click the dropdown to the right of the user's name, and choose **REMOVE FROM ORGANIZATION**.

### Change the organization's settings

If you are the administrator of an organization, you can change the organization's settings, such as change the organization's name, assign permissions, make the organization private or public, and delete the organization. You do this on the **Settings and Permissions** tab.

If you change an **organization** from private to public, the existing private bots of the organization remain private, that is, they remain visible only to the members of the organization. (Note: To change a **bot** from private to public, go to the settings for the bot and click **Danger Zone** and then **MAKE PUBLIC**.) 

If you change an **organization** from public to private, the existing public bots of the organization are also made private.

## Create and manage teams

If you are the administrator of an organization, you can create and manage teams within the organization and assign additional permissions to them. See also [Permissions](https://cai.tools.sap/docs/concepts/permissions).

### Create teams

You can create teams and add members on the **Teams** tab.

## Transfer a bot to an organization

To transfer an existing bot to one of your organizations:

1. Go to the **Settings** page for the bot.  
2. Under **Danger Zone**, click **TRANSFER OWNERSHIP**.
