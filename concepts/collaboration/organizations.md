# Organizations

Organizations are shared accounts, allowing groups of people to collaborate on several bots at the same time. Your user account (which is your identity on SAP Conversational AI) can be a member of any number of organizations.

## Create an organization

From your profile, you can create **private** and **public** organizations.

Public organizations, their public bots, and members are visible to all. Private organizations, their bots, and members are visible only to the members of the organization.

You can change an **organization** from private to public in the settings for your organization. The existing private bots of the organization will remain visible only to the members of the organization. (To change a **bot** from private to public, go to the settings for the bot and click **Danger Zone** and then **MAKE PUBLIC**.) 

## Manage an organization

Administrators manage member access to an organizationâ€™s bots. Within an organization, all members have the same bot permissions. However, only administrators can update the members list and change the organization settings. An organization must always have at least one administrator. If an organization has only one administrator, the administrator will be unable to update their own role, remove themselves from the organization, or delete their account until they make another member an administrator.

## Transfer a bot to an organization

To transfer an existing bot to one of your organizations:

1. Go to the **Settings** page for the bot.  
2. Under **Danger Zone**, click **TRANSFER OWNERSHIP**.
